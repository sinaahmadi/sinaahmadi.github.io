<p>This short blog post aims to a) give the most important steps to use a cluster for a complete newbie and b) summarize what should be done to use in the future!</p>

<h2 id="understand-a-cluster">Understand a cluster</h2>

<p>One important basic distinction that one should make is the difference between a server and a cluster. A <strong>server</strong>, also known as a <strong>node</strong>, is a single computer, pretty much like the one that you are using to read this post. On the other hand, a set of nodes connected together which are able to coordinate between themselves in a scheduled and systematic way is called a <strong>cluster</strong>. Therefore, you can imagine clusters are more robust and efficient for running intensive jobs.</p>

<p>The following figure shows a cluster.</p>

<div class="card mb-3 text-center">
    <img class="rounded mx-auto d-block" src="http://localhost:4000/docs/images/Cluster_diagram_node.png" style="width:75%" align="middle" alt="Text pre-processing using command-line" />
    <div class="card-body bg-light">

        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<p>As you see in the figure, the user initially connects to the <strong>login nodes</strong> where jobs are prepared and the requirements for running a specific code are set up. Login nodes serve as a staging area to submit jobs to the <strong>batch scheduler</strong> in the cluster.</p>

<p>Once your code, data and whatever you need to run your job is ready on the login nodes, it is time to submit your job to the batch scheduler. Once your work is <strong>queued</strong> to be submitted to the cluster, batch scheduler facilitates scheduling your job depending on your requirements in terms of memory, GPU usage and time, and those of the existing jobs on the cluster. In other words, <strong>a batch scheduler is a referee that makes sure everyone is treated fairly</strong> by reducing conflicts in resource allocation and increasing the accessibility of computing resources to the users.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we learn how to use <a href="https://slurm.schedmd.com/" target="_blank">SLURM</a>, a famous job scheduling system for large and small Linux clusters.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: How things are organized in the cluster that you use may be different from mine. Make sure you get familiar with your cluster beforehand.</p>

<h2 id="work-with-the-cluster">Work with the cluster</h2>

<p>Let’s delve more into how to use a cluster in practice.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-setup-your-data-and-code-locally">Step 1: setup your data and code locally</h3>

<p>Say, you want to train a model in Python using a set of datasets. Normally, you’d do the following:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">	python3 run_my_code.py</code></pre></figure>

<p>Now, if you want a job scheduling system like SLURM take care of training your model, you should forget about running your code directly. Rather, you should <strong>submit a job</strong> by creating a configuration in SLURM that specifies what you need from the cluster.</p>

<p>You configuration in SLURM looks like this (notice the comments that I have left with ##):</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>
<span class="c">#SBATCH -p gpuq</span>
<span class="c">#SBATCH -q gpu</span>
<span class="c">#SBATCH --job-name=test ## The name of your job</span>
<span class="c">#SBATCH --nodes=1 ## how many nodes does your need?</span>
<span class="c">#SBATCH --ntasks=8 ## how many tasks do you require?</span>
<span class="c">#SBATCH --mem=32GB ## hom much memory do you need?</span>
<span class="c">#SBATCH --gres=gpu:A100.40gb:4 ## number of GPUs per node (gres=gpu:N)</span>
<span class="c">#SBATCH --export=ALL</span>
<span class="c">#SBATCH -t 5-0:0:0 ## how much time does your job need? 5 days!</span>
<span class="c">#SBATCH --output=/scratch/your_id/training/LANG-%a-%j.txt ## where to save the output of your job</span>
<span class="c">#SBATCH --mail-type=ALL ## get notified by email about whatever happens to my job</span>
<span class="c">#SBATCH --mail-user=your_email@gmu.edu</span>

ml gnu10<span class="p">;</span> ml cuda<span class="p">;</span> ml cudnn<span class="p">;</span> ml nvidia-hpc-sdk<span class="p">;</span> ml python<span class="p">;</span> <span class="c">## module you need to load</span>

<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"Start process"</span>
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"SLURM_JOBID: "</span> <span class="nv">$SLURM_JOBID</span>

<span class="nv">RUNPATH</span><span class="o">=</span>/scratch/your_id
<span class="nb">cd</span> <span class="nv">$RUNPATH</span>

<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"Starting Venv"</span>
<span class="nb">source</span> <span class="nv">$RUNPATH</span>/envs/torch1/bin/activate <span class="c">## activate your virtual environment</span>

<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"Running the script"</span>
python3 run_my_code.py

deactivate
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"End process"</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The configuration has two main parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <strong>header</strong> where the needs of your job are specified, like memory and time</li>
  <li>The <strong>body</strong> where the set of process that you need the job to do are specified, like loading required packages, activating a virtual environment and running your code.</li>
</ul>

<p>Save this as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config.sh</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config.slurm</code> and make sure it’s in your working directory on the cluster.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-submit-the-job">Step 2: Submit the job</h3>

<p>Even though it is possible to use command-line editors like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)" target="_blank">Vim</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs" target="_blank">Emacs</a>, it is sometimes easier to handle some configurations locally. So, you can setup most of your project locally; you can always apply tiny modifications on the server later.</p>

<p>Once your code and data are available, transfer everything to your desired directory on the server. For this, usually <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scp</code> is used as follows:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">	scp my_data_code.tar.gz my_id@domain:/directory</code></pre></figure>

<p>You should make sure that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">my_id@domain:/directory</code> points to the correct directory at your profile on the cluster. As a side note, you can also transfer the data back from the server to your local machine as follows:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">	scp my_id@domain:/directory ./local_directory</code></pre></figure>

<p>And, there you go. Just submit the job using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sbatch</code> as follows:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">	sbatch config.sh</code></pre></figure>

<p>Now, you should let SLURM allocate resources to your job and train your model. You can check your jobs as follows:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">	squeue <span class="nt">-u</span> your_id </code></pre></figure>

<p>This is pretty much all!</p>

<h2 id="other-useful-commands">Other useful commands</h2>

<h4 id="always-compressdecompress-your-files">Always compress/decompress your files!</h4>

<p>To compress use this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">	<span class="nb">tar</span> <span class="nt">-czf</span> file_1 file_2 ...</code></pre></figure>

<p>and to decompress, use this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">	<span class="nb">tar</span> <span class="nt">-xvzf</span> file_name.tar.gz</code></pre></figure>

<h4 id="always-use-virtual-environment">Always use virtual environment</h4>

<p>Before submitting your job, make sure that all your required packages are installed in a virtual environment. I presonaly use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" target="_blank"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">venv</code></a> as follows:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">	python3 <span class="nt">-m</span> venv envs/my_env</code></pre></figure>

<p>and activate it within my SLURM configuration as follows:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">	<span class="nb">source</span> /envs/my_env/bin/activate</code></pre></figure>

<h4 id="organize-your-code-better">Organize your code better</h4>

<p>If you want to run programs in batches, rather than creating multiple projects and setting up the parameters for each one individually, try creating one single script and passing arguments to work with different setups. That way, you can also use job arrays (<a href="https://slurm.schedmd.com/job_array.html" target="_blank"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sarray</code></a>) to pass arguments in an array.</p>

<p>The body of your configuration would look like the following if you use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sarray</code>:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"Start process"</span>
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"SLURM_JOBID: "</span> <span class="nv">$SLURM_JOBID</span>
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID: "</span> <span class="nv">$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID</span>
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"SLURM_ARRAY_JOB_ID: "</span> <span class="nv">$SLURM_ARRAY_JOB_ID</span>

<span class="nv">RUNPATH</span><span class="o">=</span>/scratch/your_id
<span class="nb">cd</span> <span class="nv">$RUNPATH</span>

<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"Starting Venv"</span>
<span class="nb">source</span> <span class="nv">$RUNPATH</span>/envs/torch1/bin/activate <span class="c">## activate your virtual environment</span>

<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"Running the script"</span>


python3 run_my_code.py configs/LANG_<span class="nv">$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID</span>.yaml

deactivate
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"End process"</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This way, instead of submitting many jobs, you can submit only one and let SLURM iterate over the configurations using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sarray</code>.</p>

<h2 id="finally">Finally</h2>

<p>It’s a bit difficult to get used to SLURM, I must admit. However, once you learn how to use it, it’s truly enjoyable! There are many ways to make your SLURM jobs more efficient. Here are some useful links:</p>

To be addressed, hopefully, sometime in the future!</p>

<hr />

<p>There are thousands of languages around the world which are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_language">regional, minority</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_language">endangered</a> or under-documented. Oftentimes, these languages are spoken within oppressed linguistic communities where the development and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_documentation">documentation of the language</a> have received trivial or no attention.</p>

<p>Thanks to the recent advances in information technology and the global spread of the Internet among communities, many projects could document endangered and minority languages to some extent. For instance, <a href="https://wikitongues.org/">Wikitongues</a>, <a href="http://indigenoustweets.com/">Indigenous Tweets</a> or <a href="http://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/">UNESCO Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger</a>. In the same vein, I would like to create a platform for documenting endonyms, i.e. name of places used within a linguistic group.</p>

<h2 id="endonyms-a-valuable-part-of-linguistic-heritage">Endonyms, a valuable part of linguistic heritage</h2>

<p>My father was originally born in a village in Kurdistan and is native in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorani">Sorani Kurdish</a>. During a recent visit to his native region, I noticed how he knows all the details about his village: not only the name of the villages, but the name of the hills, mountains, rivers, springs and even roads! Although his knowledge of the locations where he spent his childhood seems natural in some ways, I was surprised by all the details that he knew about locations and the fact, that only a handful number of people would know those things. Maybe knowing the name of a hillock somewhere in the Kurdistan mountains would not be of importance to the Kurdish speakers or the landscape of their language, geological information are also part of the linguistic heritage of an ethnic group which should be preserved and also transferred to the future generations.</p>

            <i>Berde Reş (بەردە ڕەش - literally meaning "the black stone" in Sorani Kurdish)</i>, the name of two hillocks in Kurdistan (left and right of the photo). The name is only documented orally by the local inhabitants. Photo taken at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/gjUcD8NEYAHb4EEbA" target="_blank">(35°39'39.2"N 47°11'07.8"E)</a> in February 2021.

<p>Despite the availability of various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system">geographic coordinate systems (GPS)</a>, almost none of them is currently enriched with linguistic information provided by regional or local languages. For instance, the majority of the geographic coordinates in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdistan">regions where Kurdish</a> is spoken, are available with the official languages of the countries where Kurds are minorities. The problem has also another dimension where regional political powers run campaigns to deliberately cleanse ethnic groups, for instance read about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ba%27athist_Arabization_campaigns_in_North_Iraq">Ba’athist Arabization campaigns in North Iraq</a>.</p>

<p><em>EndoLinked</em> can be the name of a platform where endonyms are collected using the Semantic Web and Linked Data technologies. To this end, geographical coordinates are to be collected and enriched initially with various knowledge bases, such as <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/">Wikidata</a>. The collected data, is then provided to a <strong>community of native speakers</strong> where labels are provided for data instances. The platform would be an intermediate between the geological database, particularly <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap (OSM)</a> and annotators who only focus on the linguistic representation of geographical information. The following diagram provides a simple schema of how the platform would work.</p>

            A simple diagram of a geographic data population and annotation framework
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<p>From a technical point of view, the platform would collect information from OSM using its SPARQL endpoint, further enriches the collected data with information available on Wikidata and then provides the results within a specific editor to the annotator. For instance, the following SPARQL query within Wikidata, retrieves labels of the locations in English, Farsi (the official language of that region) and Sorani Kurdish.</p>

Unlike traditional databases, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database" target="_blank">relational ones</a>, where data has to adhere to a fixed schema, RDF documents are not prescribed by a schema and can be described without additional information making RDF data model self-describing. <strong>To learn more about RDF, you can read one of my previous blog posts on <a href="https://sinaahmadi.github.io/posts/rdf-data-modelling-a-tutorial.html" target="_blank">data modelling with RDF</a>.</strong></p>

<p>More recently, the concept of the Web of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data">Linked Data</a>, which makes RDF data available using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol" target="_blank">HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</a>, and <a href="http://linguistic-lod.org/" target="_blank">Linguistic Linked Open Data</a> has gained traction along with the Semantic Web, particularly in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing" target="_blank">natural language processing (NLP)</a> community as a standard for linguistic resource creation. According to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data" target="_blank">official definition</a> of W3C,</p>

<div class="ml-3">
<p class="text-muted">
Linked Data lies at the heart of what Semantic Web is all about: large scale integration of, and reasoning on, data on the Web. Almost all applications listed in, say collection of Semantic Web Case Studies and Use Cases are essentially based on the accessibility of, and integration of Linked Data at various level of complexities. 
</p>
</div>

<p>Moreover, the unique potential which the Semantic Web and Linked Data offer to electronic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicography" target="_blank">lexicography</a> enables interoperability across lexical resources by leveraging printed or unstructured linguistic data to machine-readable semantic formats.</p>

<h2 id="queries">Queries</h2>

<p>We present 10 essential queries in SPARQL, an RDF query language, for lexicographical purposes to retrieve information. To this end, we use the <a href="https://query.wikidata.org/" target="_blank">SPARQL endpoint of Wikidata</a> which comes with a few lexeme queries as example, too.</p>

<p>It is important to get familiar with <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/05/ontolex/" target="_blank">Ontolex-Lemon</a> and the <a href="https://jogracia.github.io/ontolex-lexicog/" target="_blank">Ontolex-Lemon lexicography module (lexicog)</a> as lexicographical data on Wikidata are provided based on those ontologies.</p>

<p>Moreover, a list of other useful queries are provided at:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Lexicographical_data/Ideas_of_queries">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Lexicographical_data/Ideas_of_queries</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SPARQL/WIKIDATA_Lexicographical_data" target="_blank">https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SPARQL/WIKIDATA_Lexicographical_data</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:SPARQL_query_service/queries/examples/en#Lexeme_queries" target="_blank">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:SPARQL_query_service/queries/examples/en#Lexeme_queries</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/edoc/imm7154.pdf" target="_blank">Lexemes in Wikidata: 2020 status</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, not all languages are equally represented on Wikipedia. In this tutorial, we focus on some of the richly represented ones, e.g. English and French. So, if you modify the queries to work on another language, make sure that your language is sufficiently represented on Wikidata before double-checking the soundness of the syntax of your queries.</p>

Unlike traditional databases, such as relational ones, where data has to adhere to a fixed schema, RDF documents are not prescribed by a schema and can be described without additional information making RDF data model self-describing. To learn more about RDF, you can read one of my previous blog posts on data modelling with RDF. More recently, the concept of the Web of Linked Data, which makes RDF data available using the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and Linguistic Linked Open Data has gained traction along with the Semantic Web, particularly in the natural language processing (NLP) community as a standard for linguistic resource creation. According to the official definition of W3C, Linked Data lies at the heart of what Semantic Web is all about: large scale integration of, and reasoning on, data on the Web. Almost all applications listed in, say collection of Semantic Web Case Studies and Use Cases are essentially based on the accessibility of, and integration of Linked Data at various level of complexities. Moreover, the unique potential which the Semantic Web and Linked Data offer to electronic lexicography enables interoperability across lexical resources by leveraging printed or unstructured linguistic data to machine-readable semantic formats. Semantic web and linked data facilitate retrieving information from huge resources such as printed dictionaries (Photo taken at DSL in Copenhagen) Queries We present 10 essential queries in SPARQL, an RDF query language, for lexicographical purposes to retrieve information. To this end, we use the SPARQL endpoint of Wikidata which comes with a few lexeme queries as example, too. It is important to get familiar with Ontolex-Lemon and the Ontolex-Lemon lexicography module (lexicog) as lexicographical data on Wikidata are provided based on those ontologies. Moreover, a list of other useful queries are provided at: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Lexicographical_data/Ideas_of_queries https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SPARQL/WIKIDATA_Lexicographical_data https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:SPARQL_query_service/queries/examples/en#Lexeme_queries Lexemes in Wikidata: 2020 status Unfortunately, not all languages are equally represented on Wikipedia. In this tutorial, we focus on some of the richly represented ones, e.g. English and French. So, if you modify the queries to work on another language, make sure that your language is sufficiently represented on Wikidata before double-checking the soundness of the syntax of your queries. 1- Retrieve lexemes describing book(L536) in different languages SELECT ?lemma ?languageLabel WHERE { ?l a ontolex:LexicalEntry ; ontolex:sense ?sense ; dct:language ?language ; wikibase:lemma ?lemma. ?sense wdt:P5137 wd:Q571 . # the concept for our sense is Q571 # Set the language of the labels to English. # For any variable, if label exists, add "Label" to the variable to get its label using the following: SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "en". } } Run this query 2- List the antonyms of “sadness” in English SELECT ?l ?lemma ?antonymLabel WHERE { VALUES ?lemma {'sadness'@en} ?l wikibase:lemma ?lemma; wdt:P461 ?antonym . # P461 is the property for opposite of or antonymy SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "en" . } } Run this query 3- Retrieve the lemmas in a given language with part-of-speech, glosses and usage examples SELECT ?lemma ?categoryLabel ?gloss ?example WHERE { ?l a ontolex:LexicalEntry ; dct:language ?language ; wikibase:lemma ?lemma ; wikibase:lexicalCategory ?category ; ontolex:sense ?sense . ?language wdt:P218 'en' . # Find the gloss (definition) of the senses ?sense skos:definition ?gloss . # Usage example ?l p:P5831 ?statement . ?statement ps:P5831 ?example . # Get only those lexemes for which senses are available FILTER EXISTS {?l ontolex:sense ?sense } # Set the language of the glosses to English FILTER(LANG(?gloss) = "en") SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "en" . } } LIMIT 100 Run this query 4- Find verb forms in French ending with “é” SELECT DISTINCT * WHERE { ?l a ontolex:LexicalEntry ; dct:language wd:Q150 ; wikibase:lexicalCategory wd:Q24905 ; wikibase:lemma ?lemma ; ontolex:lexicalForm ?form . ?form ontolex:representation ?word .

<p>Even though this blog post has remained much relevant even after two years, I don’t think I will update the collected data. However, I’ll provide a few links here for future readers as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://medium.com/globetrotters/6-reasons-not-to-move-to-ireland-d1c50c70ba82">6 Reasons Not to Move to Ireland</a></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>Many postgraduate students, including myself, have been recently feeling more than before ignored and exploited in Ireland, due to the lack of regulations and fair remuneration within universities. In the past few years, many student organizations have talked about our issues and tried to raise awareness among both students and university administrations about the current challenges that we are going through. A few particular examples are the <a href="https://www.universitytimes.ie/2020/09/nuig-postgraduate-students-strike-against-unpaid-teaching-hours/" target="_blank">unpaid teaching hours at the National University of Ireland Galway</a>, <a href="https://www.change.org/p/president-of-nui-galway-postgraduate-workers-alliance-demands-for-a-fair-working-environment-at-nui-galway" target="_blank">demands for a fair working environment at NUI Galway</a> and <a href="https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/ive-had-enough-trinity-phd-student-writes-to-minister-demanding-rent-subsidy-38462354.html" target="_blank">Trinity PhD student writes to minister demanding rent subsidy</a>.</p>

<p>With the restrictions that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019" target="_blank">COVID-19</a> imposed on our world, including Ireland, a few aspects of our lives as PhD students became more salient. If we could previously forget some of our difficulties temporarily by going out with friends and have a pint or two in the pubs, now, those are gone and the majority of us are left with a computer and a desk in, most probably, a room within a shared space. Yet this year, the icing on the cake was when we were notified that teaching hours will remain <em>unpaid</em> just like before despite all the current difficulties.</p>

<p>On a personal side, I went through a period of turmoil when I was looking for a new place to move in and was reminded every day how miserably one should adapt oneself to the mediocre accommodation situation of Ireland, having a highly infectious disease spreading around as well. What if every one of us could live in more decent conditions and could actually spend the lockdowns more peacefully by focusing on our research, obtaining new skills or spending more time with friends and family virtually?! Wouldn’t that happen by first having a private place to live in?</p>

<p>During many discussions with fellow students and researchers, it turned out that our rights as students are not equally understood. Although comparisons are good ways to highlight the differences between two countries, oftentimes many factors should be taken into account to have a fair comparison. Therefore, in order to have a better understanding of the current situation in comparison to other European countries, particularly Nordic countries and those in Western Europe, I collected data from various sources to answer the following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Q1: How much a PhD student is paid?</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Q2: Which countries consider a PhD student stipendiary/civil servant?</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Q3: How much does a PhD student pay to enrol for a program?</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Q4: What is the minimum wage of each country?</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Q5: How much is the average rent for a 1-bedroom flat?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I believe, to have a fair image on how PhD life looks like in a country, we should include many factors, particularly these ones. In addition, these questions may help future students, who want to pursue their PhD studies in one of the European countries, have a more comprehensive image of how their 3-4 years of PhD life would look like.</p>

<h2 id="data-collection">Data collection</h2>

<p>In order to collect the data, I consulted the legitimate sources of information, such as <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr" target="_blank">Légifrance</a> for France, that provide the latest rules and regulations. It is worth mentioning that finding out how PhD students are paid in different countries is not as straightforward as it may look. The European Union used to publish annual reports in their <a href="https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/no/node/5771" target="_blank">policy library</a>, but this does not seem to be the case since 2014 (see <a href="https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/no/node/5771#document-collapsible-eu-policies-researcher-report-2014" target="_blank">Researcher Reports 2014</a>, for example). As an alternative source of information, I relied on the data provided by <a href="https://fastepo.com">Fastepo</a> and, in a couple of cases <a href="https://www.glassdoor.ie" target="_blank">glassdoor</a>. Moreover, in countries where PhD students are paid a salary and not a stipend, there are many issues with respect to how the net salary should be calculated. Given the complexity, I only included the minimum possible salary reported in my sources for the most basic conditions, i.e. 0 year experience, 1st year of PhD, 0 year seniority. Therefore, the numbers provided here are for the most basic conditions for a PhD student.</p>

<p>Please note that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There is possibly a margin of error in the collected data.</li>
  <li>All values are dependent on many other factors such as student’s nationality, seniority, taxation, etc. The most frequent case is considered.</li>
  <li>The data are collected on September 2020.</li>
  <li>All the values are in Euro (€).</li>
</ul>

<p>Most European countries apply a model of free higher education. The current data are for full-time PhD students from EU/EEA/Switzerland. It should be noted that administrative fees and personal insurance also exist in most countries making the tuition fees not completely out of charge (but within reasonable rates).</p>

<p>The minimum rate of pay or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage">minimum wage</a> is a measure to evaluate what amount of money is required to live with minimal conditions in a country. The rates are subject to modification every year based on many factors such as inflation rate and gross domestic product.</p>

<h2 id="paid-teaching-duties-a-trivial-but-important-source-of-extra-income">Paid teaching duties: a trivial but important source of extra income</h2>

<p>In many countries, PhD students do a certain amount of <em>paid teaching hours</em> to earn some extra money. Deprived of such opportunities, PhD students in Ireland teach without being paid. This not only demoralizes students to get involved in teaching activities, but also makes them finish their PhD courses with a less interesting CV than other students in the mainland Europe.</p>

<h2 id="irish-residence-permit-a-deal-breaker">Irish residence permit: a deal breaker?</h2>

<p>One major difference in doing PhD in any other country in the EU in comparison to Ireland is the residence permit. The residence permit in Ireland is basically a certificate showing that you have a regular status in the country and you are not illegal. It doesn’t let you travel anywhere out of Ireland, even to Northern Ireland! While in the other EU countries, your residence permit is also a proof that makes it possible to travel freely in the other Schengen countries, from Cyprus to France, From Norway to Malta.</p>

<p><strong>If you hold a passport that requires visa to travel to other European countries, you should think twice about the fact that Ireland is not in the Schengen area. That basically means that you won’t feel much European and will have to spend your time applying for visa every time you want to visit mainland Europe.</strong> On the other hand, with a residence permit from any other EU country, you have way more chances to appreciate the beauty of all countries in Europe!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Here are the facts based on the collected data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Among all the Western European countries, Ireland
    <ul>
      <li>is the only country where PhD students are paid less than the minimum wage.</li>
      <li>is the only country where PhD students are not paid for teaching activities.</li>
      <li>has the highest tuition fees.</li>
      <li>along with the UK, Spain, Belgium and Portugal, are the countries where PhD students are paid a stipend and have no public service status.</li>
      <li>along with the UK, have the highest rents.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I am not going to draw any conclusion from the data shown here. I believe that every one, depending on his/her life conditions, would evaluate the answers to the aforementioned questions differently.

However, I’ll provide a few links here for future readers as follows: 6 Reasons Not to Move to Ireland Many postgraduate students, including myself, have been recently feeling more than before ignored and exploited in Ireland, due to the lack of regulations and fair remuneration within universities. In the past few years, many student organizations have talked about our issues and tried to raise awareness among both students and university administrations about the current challenges that we are going through. A few particular examples are the unpaid teaching hours at the National University of Ireland Galway, demands for a fair working environment at NUI Galway and Trinity PhD student writes to minister demanding rent subsidy. With the restrictions that COVID-19 imposed on our world, including Ireland, a few aspects of our lives as PhD students became more salient. If we could previously forget some of our difficulties temporarily by going out with friends and have a pint or two in the pubs, now, those are gone and the majority of us are left with a computer and a desk in, most probably, a room within a shared space. Yet this year, the icing on the cake was when we were notified that teaching hours will remain unpaid just like before despite all the current difficulties. On a personal side, I went through a period of turmoil when I was looking for a new place to move in and was reminded every day how miserably one should adapt oneself to the mediocre accommodation situation of Ireland, having a highly infectious disease spreading around as well. What if every one of us could live in more decent conditions and could actually spend the lockdowns more peacefully by focusing on our research, obtaining new skills or spending more time with friends and family virtually?! Wouldn’t that happen by first having a private place to live in? During many discussions with fellow students and researchers, it turned out that our rights as students are not equally understood. Although comparisons are good ways to highlight the differences between two countries, oftentimes many factors should be taken into account to have a fair comparison. Therefore, in order to have a better understanding of the current situation in comparison to other European countries, particularly Nordic countries and those in Western Europe, I collected data from various sources to answer the following questions: Q1: How much a PhD student is paid? Q2: Which countries consider a PhD student stipendiary/civil servant? Q3: How much does a PhD student pay to enrol for a program? Q4: What is the minimum wage of each country? Q5: How much is the average rent for a 1-bedroom flat? I believe, to have a fair image on how PhD life looks like in a country, we should include many factors, particularly these ones. In addition, these questions may help future students, who want to pursue their PhD studies in one of the European countries, have a more comprehensive image of how their 3-4 years of PhD life would look like. Data collection In order to collect the data, I consulted the legitimate sources of information, such as Légifrance for France, that provide the latest rules and regulations. It is worth mentioning that finding out how PhD students are paid in different countries is not as straightforward as it may look. The European Union used to publish annual reports in their policy library, but this does not seem to be the case since 2014 (see Researcher Reports 2014, for example). As an alternative source of information, I relied on the data provided by Fastepo and, in a couple of cases glassdoor. Moreover, in countries where PhD students are paid a salary and not a stipend, there are many issues with respect to how the net salary should be calculated. Given the complexity, I only included the minimum possible salary reported in my sources for the most basic conditions, i.e. 0 year experience, 1st year of PhD, 0 year seniority. Therefore, the numbers provided here are for the most basic conditions for a PhD student. Please note that: There is possibly a margin of error in the collected data. All values are dependent on many other factors such as student’s nationality, seniority, taxation, etc. The most frequent case is considered. The data are collected on September 2020. All the values are in Euro (€). You can download my collected data in this spreadsheet or directly click on Get the data within each plot. Q1: How much a PhD student is paid? Q2: Which countries consider a PhD student stipendiary/civil servant? In the countries where PhD students are considered public servants, a set of rules are also applicable for them as for the normal university staff, such as pension, social security and residence status (for no-EU students). Q3: How much does a PhD student pay to enrol for a program? Most European countries apply a model of free higher education. The current data are for full-time PhD students from EU/EEA/Switzerland. It should be noted that administrative fees and personal insurance also exist in most countries making the tuition fees not completely out of charge (but within reasonable rates). Q4: What is the minimum wage of each country? The minimum rate of pay or minimum wage is a measure to evaluate what amount of money is required to live with minimal conditions in a country. The rates are subject to modification every year based on many factors such as inflation rate and gross domestic product. In the following plot, the monthly minimum wages (bi-annual data 2020) of our target countries are provided. These rates represent gross salary. Minimum wages by country (Source: List of European countries by minimum wage on Wikipedia). We can compare the minimum net wage rates with the minimum PhD income to find out how sufficiently a PhD student is paid as follows: PhD income vs. minimum wage rates (net) in some of the Western European countries Based on this data, Sarah Ennis created the following more beautiful plot (Thanks Sarah!): The relationship between minimum wage and PhD income. Q5: How much is the average rent for a 1-bedroom flat? Source: Eurostat Paid teaching duties: a trivial but important source of extra income In many countries, PhD students do a certain amount of paid teaching hours to earn some extra money. Deprived of such opportunities, PhD students in Ireland teach without being paid. This not only demoralizes students to get involved in teaching activities, but also makes them finish their PhD courses with a less interesting CV than other students in the mainland Europe. Irish residence permit: a deal breaker? One major difference in doing PhD in any other country in the EU in comparison to Ireland is the residence permit. The residence permit in Ireland is basically a certificate showing that you have a regular status in the country and you are not illegal. It doesn’t let you travel anywhere out of Ireland, even to Northern Ireland! While in the other EU countries, your residence permit is also a proof that makes it possible to travel freely in the other Schengen countries, from Cyprus to France, From Norway to Malta. If you hold a passport that requires visa to travel to other European countries, you should think twice about the fact that Ireland is not in the Schengen area. That basically means that you won’t feel much European and will have to spend your time applying for visa every time you want to visit mainland Europe. On the other hand, with a residence permit from any other EU country, you have way more chances to appreciate the beauty of all countries in Europe! For more information, check this out: https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving_country/moving_to_ireland/rights_of_residence_in_ireland/registration_of_non_eea_nationals_in_ireland.html. Conclusion Here are the facts based on the collected data: Among all the Western European countries, Ireland is the only country where PhD students are paid less than the minimum wage. is the only country where PhD students are not paid for teaching activities. has the highest tuition fees. along with the UK, Spain, Belgium and Portugal, are the countries where PhD students are paid a stipend and have no public service status. along with the UK, have the highest rents. I am not going to draw any conclusion from the data shown here. I believe that every one, depending on his/her life conditions, would evaluate the answers to the aforementioned questions differently. I am sure the reader knows that things are not always black and white and any comparison should be made in a fair way.

<h2 id="what-is-wrong">What is wrong?</h2>

<p>Imagine, after years of study and research, you publish a seminal work in your field in a journal. Your paper is very theoretical and sheds light on a complex and unsolved problem. After a while, a few other researchers get another idea from various sources including yours, and publish another paper where your paper is also cited. In such a scenario and given the current citation calculation method, your paper would get a citation of 1. However, after a few months, it turns out that the other paper has paved the way for a new branch in your field and therefore, is being cited thousands of times in a year. Now, the question is: <strong>how your contribution and your idea that helped to untie the Gordian knot can be acknowledged properly?</strong></p>

<p>Let’s take a look at an example. Paper A and C which are respectively published in 2013 and 2014, are cited 1 time. The papers that cited those given papers are themselves being cited by succeeding papers. Let’s focus on Paper B, published in 2015, which is cited 8 times. Even if Paper A provided the theoretical base that led to the authors of the Paper B to conclude with a new theorem, Paper A still has 1 citation and this may probably stay so, as the scientific community will be built upon Paper B, rather than Paper A due to the lack of direct citation of the latter. Recently, <a href="#Bollmann">Bollmann and Elliott</a> has addressed the same issue with a focus on the older papers in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and states that:</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote" style="text-align: center;">
... recently published papers (0–3 years old) are cited significantly more often in publications from recent years (ca. 2015–2019), while papers published 15 or more years ago are being cited at a stable rate.
</blockquote>

<h2 id="a-solution">A solution</h2>

<p>We can model the citation problem as a weighted directed graph (or also tree), where nodes represent papers and edges represent citations. The following illustrates Papers A, B and C, as mentioned earlier:</p>

<div class="card mb-3 text-center">
    <img class="rounded mx-auto d-block" src="http://localhost:4000/docs/images/papers_bipartite_graph.png" style="width:50%" align="middle" alt="papers bipartite graph" />
    <div class="card-body bg-light">
        <div class="card-text">
            While Paper A proposes many ideas that led to the achievements in Paper B, the fact that Paper B has attracted more attention with 8 citations does not change anything with respect to Paper A
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<p>Here is a simple solution. When a paper is cited, instead of considering direct citations, all future papers that cite succeeding papers will have an impact on the current one based on their citation counts and number of papers that they cite. To further clarify, let’s get back to our graph above. Paper B cites Paper A and Paper C. The two latter papers are cited once each one. If we divide the whole number of citations of Paper B, i.e. 8, to the number of papers that it cites, i.e. 2, Paper A and Paper C each one will have 4 citation impacts. Citation impact of a paper cited by a paper that has not been cited is 0.</p>

<p>Therefore, we can define citation impact of paper \(i\), \(CI_i\), as follows:</p>

\[CI_i = \sum_{j \in J}^{} \frac{CI_j}{|cite(i)|}\]

<p>where \(i\) is a given paper, \(J\) is the set of papers that directly cite \(i\), \(CI_j\) is the citation impact of the papers that cite paper \(i\) and |\(cite(i)\)| is the number of papers that paper \(i\) cites. We set the citation impact of parents of children nodes, i.e. papers which are not cited at all, as the whole number of citations.</p>

<p>The following shows a more detailed scenario where the impact of papers that cite B is propagated to the older citations in such a way that papers A and C have a citation impact of 5 while their direct citation remains 1.</p>

<div class="card mb-3 text-center">
    <img class="rounded mx-auto d-block" src="http://localhost:4000/docs/images/papers_graph_citation_impact.png" style="width:50%" align="middle" alt="papers bipartite graph" />
    <div class="card-body bg-light">
        <div class="card-text">
            In the proposed approach, the impact of each citation is propagated through the graph of cited papers in such a way that all previously cited papers get the sum of the succeeding citation impacts
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<h2 id="a-better-weighting-policy">A better weighting policy?</h2>

<p>In the current approach, all cited papers have the same weight in calculating the citation impact. In other words, whether a paper is cited in the related work or in the methodology, it is acknowledged in the same way in terms of the citation impact. To solve this, a mechanism may be required to distinguish the importance of the cited articles from the authors’ point of view.</p>

<p>I think there are many ways to improve our current citation calculation systems and also the way that we write manuscripts. This simple method, despite its simplicity, provides a more comprehensive way to reflect the importance of a paper in shaping the future of a scientific field.</p>

For this purpose, I wanted to use GIZA++, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_machine_translation" target="_blank">statistical machine translation</a> toolkit that is used to train <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_alignment_models" target="_blank">IBM Models 1-5</a> and an HMM word alignment model. The toolkit is a bit outdated and does not seem to be further developped. Therefore, it was a bit challenging to find out how to install and use it.</p>

<p>In this post, I am going to go through each step of installing GIZA++ with an alignment example. I have tested the following on my macOS (Catalina).</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="1--install-giza">1- Install GIZA++</h2>

<p>There are various version of GIZA++ available on the web, including that on the <a href="http://www.statmt.org/moses/giza/GIZA++.html" target="_blank">official website</a> and another one <a href="https://github.com/moses-smt/giza-pp" target="_blank">on Github</a>. I found the latter less problematic to install on modern machines.</p>

<p>Download the zipped repository at <a href="https://github.com/moses-smt/giza-pp" target="_blank">https://github.com/moses-smt/giza-pp</a> and unzip it locally or, clone it as follows:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git clone git@github.com:moses-smt/giza-pp.git
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As GIZA++ was initially written for Linux, we need to apply a few modifications to use it on a case-insensitive file system like macOS.</p>

<p>Navigate to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">giza-pp/</code> and then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GIZA++-v2</code> directory and edit lines 321-322 of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">model3.cpp</code> file which contains the following:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>      alignfile = Prefix + ".A3." + number ;
      test_alignfile = Prefix + ".tst.A3." + number ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>to this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>      alignfile = Prefix + ".AA3." + number ;
      test_alignfile = Prefix + ".tst.AA3." + number ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can do it by simply opening the file in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vim</code> and modify it as follows:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cd giza-pp/GIZA++-v2
$ vim +321 model3.cpp
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These solutions were found thanks to <a href="http://catherinegasnier.blogspot.com/2014/04/install-giza-107-on-mac-osx-1092.html" target="_blank">this</a> and <a href="http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Using_GIZA%2B%2B" target="_blank">this</a> websites.</p>

<p>Now, in the same <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">giza-pp/GIZA++-v2</code> directory, edit line 9 of the GIZA++ <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Makefile</code>. That line contains the following:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>CFLAGS_OPT = $(CFLAGS) -O3 -funroll-loops -DNDEBUG -DWORDINDEX_WITH_4_BYTE -DBINARY_SEARCH_FOR_TTABLE -DWORDINDEX_WITH_4_BYTE
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and it should be changed to this new one:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>CFLAGS_OPT = $(CFLAGS) -O3 -funroll-loops -DNDEBUG -DWORDINDEX_WITH_4_BYTE
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And one last modification is with regard to references to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tr1</code> which are not supported by macOS. Running the following lines will fix that problem too (make sure you are in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">giza-pp</code> directory):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cd giza-pp
perl -pi -w -e 's/&lt;tr1\//&lt;/g;' GIZA++-v2/* mkcls-v2/*
perl -pi -w -e 's/using namespace std::tr1;//g;' GIZA++-v2/* mkcls-v2/*
perl -pi -w -e 's/std::tr1:://g;' GIZA++-v2/* mkcls-v2/*
sed '36d' mkcls-v2/mystl.h &gt; mkcls-v2/mystl.h.tmp
sed '50d' mkcls-v2/mystl.h.tmp &gt; mkcls-v2/mystl.h
rm mkcls-v2/mystl.h.tmp
make
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The final line, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make</code>, will take a while and make your files. Now, we are OK with GIZA++.</p>

<h2 id="2--prepare-your-data">2- Prepare your data</h2>

<p>For this tutorial, I would like to align the English and Irish versions of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Ireland" target="_blank">Constitution of Ireland</a>. Download the two files and put them in a new directory, let’s say <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">giza_example/</code> in the same directory of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">giza-pp</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sinaahmadi/Advanced-Natural-Language-Processing-Course/master/Constitution_of_Ireland.tok.en" target="_blank">Constitution_of_Ireland.en</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sinaahmadi/Advanced-Natural-Language-Processing-Course/master/Constitution_of_Ireland.tok.ga" target="_blank">Constitution_of_Ireland.ga</a></li>
</ul>

<p>These two files are already tokenized with spaces. This can be done by any tool or library of your choice, such as <a href="https://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder/blob/master/scripts/tokenizer/tokenizer.perl" target="_blank">Moses</a> or <a href="https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.tokenize.html" target="_blank">NLTK</a>.</p>

<p>Make sure that your data are parallel, that is the same line in each file refers to the same thing in different languages.</p>

<h2 id="3--align-the-words">3- Align the words</h2>

<p>Following the two previous steps, you should now be ready to align words in your parallel data. To do so, first, we should create a few files required for GIZA++ to find the most probable alignments.</p>

<p>Assuming that your working directory looks like this (the parallel data are in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">giza_example</code>):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>.
├── GIZA++-v2
├── giza_example
└── mkcls-v2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Navigate to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GIZA++-v2</code> directory and run the following which will generate the vocabulary (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.vcb</code>) and sentences files (`.snt):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>./plain2snt.out ../giza_example/Constitution_of_Ireland.tok.en ../giza_example/Constitution_of_Ireland.tok.ga 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">giza_example</code> directory contains the following files:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Constitution_of_Ireland.tok.ga.vcb
Constitution_of_Ireland.tok.ga_Constitution_of_Ireland.tok.en.snt
Constitution_of_Ireland.tok.ga

Constitution_of_Ireland.tok.en
Constitution_of_Ireland.ga

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The next step is to extract the co-occurrences by running the following:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>./snt2cooc.out ../giza_example/Constitution_of_Ireland.tok.en.vcb ../giza_example/Constitution_of_Ireland.tok.ga.vcb ../giza_example/Constitution_of_Ireland.tok.ga_Constitution_of_Ireland.tok.en.snt &gt; ../giza_example/corp.cooc
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Although it doesn’t matter which <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.snt</code> file you are providing, you should make sure that you will provide <strong>the same thing</strong> in the next step as it’s going to be your source resource.</p>

<p>And finally, in the same directory of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GIZA++-v2</code>, run GIZA++ as follows:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>./GIZA++ -S ../giza_example/Constitution_of_Ireland.tok.ga.vcb -T ../giza_example/Constitution_of_Ireland.tok.en.vcb -C ../giza_example/Constitution_of_Ireland.tok.ga_Constitution_of_Ireland.tok.en.snt -CoocurrenceFile ../giza_example/corp.cooc -outputpath ../giza_example/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>All these steps should provide you with many files including <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/giza_example/2020-04-01.030523.sina.AA3.final</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/giza_example/2020-04-01.030523.sina.actual.ti.final</code> (ignore the file prefixes):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2020-04-01.030523.sina.AA3.final</code>: contains sentence pairs and word alignments from the source language (Irish) into the target language (English) using Viterbi Alignment, which is the most probable alignment (the one that maximizes the alignment probability). One particular sentence pair of this file looks like the following:</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># Sentence pair (43) source length 12 target length 17 alignment score : 6.81325e-23
the name of the state is éire , or , in the english language , ireland . 
NULL ({ 3 8 12 }) éire ({ 1 }) is ({ }) ainm ({ 2 }) don ({ 4 }) stát ({ 5 }) nó ({ 9 }) , ({ 10 }) sa ({ 11 }) sacs-bhéarla ({ 13 14 }) , ({ 15 }) ireland ({ 6 7 16 }) . ({ 17 }) 
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The first line shows the length (number of words) of the source (Irish) and target (English) sentences, along with the Viterbi alignment score.</p>

<p>The second line is the target sentence, and the third line is the source sentence annotated with alignment information. Each source word is annotated with the set of indices of target words that are aligned to that source word. Note that in IBM Models assume that one target word is aligned at most one source word. The first <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NULL ({ 3 8 12 })</code> means that the 3rd, 8th and 12th target words, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">of</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">,</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">the</code>, are not aligned to any words, while <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stát ({ 5 })</code> is aligned with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">state</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2020-04-01.030523.sina.actual.ti.final</code>: This is the final inverse T-tables (lexical translation probability) trained by the model. Lexical translation probability <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">t(e|f)</code> is the probability that word <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f</code> in the source language (Irish) is translated to word <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">e</code> in the target language (Target). Since this is the inverse T-tables, it contains <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">t(f|e)</code>. The following is a sample of the file:</li>

<p>Last updated on 1 April 2020.</p>]]></content><author><name>Sina Ahmadi</name></author><category term="Tutorial" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, I was working on a task for which I needed to align sentences in two languages in a parallel corpus. For this purpose, I wanted to use GIZA++, a statistical machine translation toolkit that is used to train IBM Models 1-5 and an HMM word alignment model. The toolkit is a bit outdated and does not seem to be further developped. Therefore, it was a bit challenging to find out how to install and use it. In this post, I am going to go through each step of installing GIZA++ with an alignment example. I have tested the following on my macOS (Catalina). 1- Install GIZA++ There are various version of GIZA++ available on the web, including that on the official website and another one on Github. I found the latter less problematic to install on modern machines. Download the zipped repository at https://github.com/moses-smt/giza-pp and unzip it locally or, clone it as follows: $ git clone git@github.com:moses-smt/giza-pp.git As GIZA++ was initially written for Linux, we need to apply a few modifications to use it on a case-insensitive file system like macOS. Navigate to the giza-pp/ and then GIZA++-v2 directory and edit lines 321-322 of the model3.cpp file which contains the following: alignfile = Prefix + ".A3." + number ; test_alignfile = Prefix + ".tst.A3." + number ; to this: alignfile = Prefix + ".AA3." + number ; test_alignfile = Prefix + ".tst.AA3." + number ; You can do it by simply opening the file in Vim and modify it as follows: cd giza-pp/GIZA++-v2 $ vim +321 model3.cpp These solutions were found thanks to this and this websites. Now, in the same giza-pp/GIZA++-v2 directory, edit line 9 of the GIZA++ Makefile. That line contains the following: CFLAGS_OPT = $(CFLAGS) -O3 -funroll-loops -DNDEBUG -DWORDINDEX_WITH_4_BYTE -DBINARY_SEARCH_FOR_TTABLE -DWORDINDEX_WITH_4_BYTE and it should be changed to this new one: CFLAGS_OPT = $(CFLAGS) -O3 -funroll-loops -DNDEBUG -DWORDINDEX_WITH_4_BYTE And one last modification is with regard to references to tr1 which are not supported by macOS. Running the following lines will fix that problem too (make sure you are in the giza-pp directory): cd giza-pp perl -pi -w -e 's/&lt;tr1\//&lt;/g;' GIZA++-v2/* mkcls-v2/* perl -pi -w -e 's/using namespace std::tr1;//g;' GIZA++-v2/* mkcls-v2/* perl -pi -w -e 's/std::tr1:://g;' GIZA++-v2/* mkcls-v2/* sed '36d' mkcls-v2/mystl.h &gt; mkcls-v2/mystl.h.tmp sed '50d' mkcls-v2/mystl.h.tmp &gt; mkcls-v2/mystl.h rm mkcls-v2/mystl.h.tmp make The final line, make, will take a while and make your files. Now, we are OK with GIZA++. 2- Prepare your data For this tutorial, I would like to align the English and Irish versions of the Constitution of Ireland. Download the two files and put them in a new directory, let’s say giza_example/ in the same directory of giza-pp: Constitution_of_Ireland.en Constitution_of_Ireland.ga These two files are already tokenized with spaces. This can be done by any tool or library of your choice, such as Moses or NLTK. Make sure that your data are parallel, that is the same line in each file refers to the same thing in different languages. 3- Align the words Following the two previous steps, you should now be ready to align words in your parallel data. To do so, first, we should create a few files required for GIZA++ to find the most probable alignments. Assuming that your working directory looks like this (the parallel data are in giza_example): . ├── GIZA++-v2 ├── giza_example └── mkcls-v2 Navigate to the GIZA++-v2 directory and run the following which will generate the vocabulary (.vcb) and sentences files (`.snt): ./plain2snt.out ../giza_example/Constitution_of_Ireland.tok.en ../giza_example/Constitution_of_Ireland.tok.ga Now, your giza_example directory contains the following files: Constitution_of_Ireland.tok.ga.vcb Constitution_of_Ireland.tok.ga_Constitution_of_Ireland.tok.en.snt Constitution_of_Ireland.tok.ga Constitution_of_Ireland.tok.en.vcb Constitution_of_Ireland.tok.en_Constitution_of_Ireland.tok.ga.snt Constitution_of_Ireland.tok.en Constitution_of_Ireland.ga Constitution_of_Ireland.en The next step is to extract the co-occurrences by running the following: ./snt2cooc.out ../giza_example/Constitution_of_Ireland.tok.en.vcb ../giza_example/Constitution_of_Ireland.tok.ga.vcb ../giza_example/Constitution_of_Ireland.tok.ga_Constitution_of_Ireland.tok.en.snt &gt; ../giza_example/corp.cooc Although it doesn’t matter which .snt file you are providing, you should make sure that you will provide the same thing in the next step as it’s going to be your source resource. And finally, in the same directory of GIZA++-v2, run GIZA++ as follows: ./GIZA++ -S ../giza_example/Constitution_of_Ireland.tok.ga.vcb -T ../giza_example/Constitution_of_Ireland.tok.en.vcb -C ../giza_example/Constitution_of_Ireland.tok.ga_Constitution_of_Ireland.tok.en.snt -CoocurrenceFile ../giza_example/corp.cooc -outputpath ../giza_example/ All these steps should provide you with many files including /giza_example/2020-04-01.030523.sina.AA3.final and /giza_example/2020-04-01.030523.sina.actual.ti.final (ignore the file prefixes): 2020-04-01.030523.sina.AA3.final: contains sentence pairs and word alignments from the source language (Irish) into the target language (English) using Viterbi Alignment, which is the most probable alignment (the one that maximizes the alignment probability). One particular sentence pair of this file looks like the following: # Sentence pair (43) source length 12 target length 17 alignment score : 6.81325e-23 the name of the state is éire , or , in the english language , ireland . NULL ({ 3 8 12 }) éire ({ 1 }) is ({ }) ainm ({ 2 }) don ({ 4 }) stát ({ 5 }) nó ({ 9 }) , ({ 10 }) sa ({ 11 }) sacs-bhéarla ({ 13 14 }) , ({ 15 }) ireland ({ 6 7 16 }) . ({ 17 }) The first line shows the length (number of words) of the source (Irish) and target (English) sentences, along with the Viterbi alignment score. The second line is the target sentence, and the third line is the source sentence annotated with alignment information. Each source word is annotated with the set of indices of target words that are aligned to that source word. Note that in IBM Models assume that one target word is aligned at most one source word. The first NULL ({ 3 8 12 }) means that the 3rd, 8th and 12th target words, of, , and the, are not aligned to any words, while stát ({ 5 }) is aligned with state. 2020-04-01.030523.sina.actual.ti.final: This is the final inverse T-tables (lexical translation probability) trained by the model. Lexical translation probability t(e|f) is the probability that word f in the source language (Irish) is translated to word e in the target language (Target). Since this is the inverse T-tables, it contains t(f|e).

<h2>List of printed dictionaries in Kurdish</h2>
<p>
The following table contains all the printed dictionaries dealing with the Kurdish language. The following information are provided for each resource:

<ul>
	<li>Author: This is the author's last name. As not all dictionaries have a name, author's name seems more efficient to find out more information about the resource. </li>
	<li>Type: monolingual, bilingual or multilingual</li>
	<li>Year: year of publication</li>
	<li>Source: the source language or dialect</li>
	<li>Target: the target language or dialect</li>
	<li># Entries: number of entries in each resource. * shows an estimation of the number of entries which is calculated based on the number of the pages and density of entries per page.</li>
	<li>Script: the script or orthography in which the Kurdish text is written. In some resources, the author uses a self-made script based on the known ones. To show this customization, ~ is used.</li>
	<li>Content: an analysis of the content of the lexicographic data?</li>
</ul>

More details about the resources can be found in the <a href="/bibliography/KurdishLexicography.txt" target="_blank">bibliography file</a> where authors' name are used as the index of each bibliographic entry. And finally, in cases of uncertainty, ? is used.

The following information are provided for each resource: Author: This is the author's last name. As not all dictionaries have a name, author's name seems more efficient to find out more information about the resource. Type: monolingual, bilingual or multilingual Year: year of publication Source: the source language or dialect Target: the target language or dialect # Entries: number of entries in each resource. * shows an estimation of the number of entries which is calculated based on the number of the pages and density of entries per page. Script: the script or orthography in which the Kurdish text is written. In some resources, the author uses a self-made script based on the known ones. To show this customization, ~ is used. Content: an analysis of the content of the lexicographic data? More details about the resources can be found in the bibliography file where authors' name are used as the index of each bibliographic entry. And finally, in cases of uncertainty, ? is used. # Author Type Year Source Target # Entries Script Content 1 Garzoni bilingual 1787 Italian Kurmanji 5250* ~Latin translation 2 Jaba bilingual 1879 Kurmanji French 14340* ~Persian-Arabic and ~Latin translation, example sentences 3 Mokri bilingual 1892 Kurmanji Arabic 7200* ~Persian-Arabic translations, present stem of verbs 4 Mukryani bilingual 1950 Arabic Sorani 15000 Persian-Arabic translations 5 Bakaev bilingual 1957 Kurmanji Russian 14000 Cyrillic translations, gender, expressions, variant forms 6 Farizov bilingual 1957 Russian Kurmanji 30000 Latin translations, gender, expressions, variant forms 7 Siabandov &amp; Châchân bilingual 1957 Armenian Kurmanji 23000 Cyrillic translation 8 Kurdoev bilingual 1960 Kurmanji Russian 34,000 Cyrillic detailed translations with polysemy, gender, expressions, variant forms 9 Xal monolingual 1960 Sorani Sorani 22000* Persian-Arabic definition, synonyms 10 Mukryani bilingual 1961 Sorani Arabic 30000 Persian-Arabic translations 11 Bedirxan &amp; Keskin monolingual 1962 Kurmanji Kurmanji 15000* Latin synonyms 12 Blau multilingual 1965 Kurmanji (French-English) 6000* Latin translations, gender, present stem of verbs, limited POS 13 Wahby &amp; Edmonds bilingual 1966 Sorani English 6500* ~Latin, Persian-Arabic POS, synonyms and variant forms, rich description 14 Mukryani multilingual 1966 Sorani (Persian-Arabic-English-French) 4000* Persian-Arabic translations 15 MacKenzie bilingual 1966 Hawrami English 1000 ~Latin translation, POS, gender, idioms, example sentences, variant forms 16 Anter bilingual 1967 Kurmanji Turkish ?

<p>I still remember that scene in front of my eyes, just like it is happening now.

He could not pronounce a phoneme correctly, because he was forced to speak in a language which was not his.

<h2 id="you-dont-choose-it-youre-born-with">You don’t choose it. You’re born with.</h2>

<p>Kurds are an ethnicity of 20-30 million of population who are native to Kurdistan, a region which is geographically located in the Middle East and Caucasus, and politically, divided between four countries: Iraq, Turkey, Iran and Syria. Except the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, Kurdish is recognized as the formal language of none of the three latter countries. Kurdish people, are not only culturally close to their neighbouring ethnicities, namely Turks, Persians, Arabs, Armenians, Assyrians and etc., they also speak a language which has been historically influenced by them. Kurdish, as an Indo-European language, also shares a lot of linguistic features with its neighbouring languages.</p>

<p>I was born and raised in the Kurdistan of Iran where the Kurdish language, in a variety of dialects, is spoken by the Kurdish inhabitants. Despite the ethnic and linguistic richness of Iran, none of them is recognized and none of their languages is supported as a formal language, even locally. Persian, also known by its endonym Farsi, is the only predominant and official language in Iran. In other words, the educational and administrative systems are only available in one single language, while almost half of the Iranian population are born with a language other than Persian. Even the name of the places, villages, cities and local traditions and products are translated into the official language and any other language is systematically disregarded.</p>

<p>There is a saying in Persian that <em>“Persian is sugar”</em>. I am sure for Dyako and all those who were and still are <em>forced</em> to learn it, it’s as bitter as gall!</p>

<h2 id="a-personality-crisis">A personality crisis</h2>

<p>A language is a living organism which is being constantly developed. Therefore, the process of learning mother language is not limited to cognitive development in the first years of life, but a considerable amount of knowledge is obtained through intellectual development. Our lexical knowledge gets progressively enriched to describe sophisticated and abstract concepts. <a href="https://ie-today.co.uk/Blog/the-importance-of-mother-tongue-in-education/" target="_blank">Independent Education Today</a> and <a href="http://www.lavplu.eu/central/bibliografie/cummins_eng.pdf" target="_blank">this article</a> summarize the research findings about what we know about mother tongue development as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mother tongue develops a child’s personal, social and cultural identity</li>
  <li>Using mother tongue helps a child develop their critical thinking and literacy skills</li>
  <li>Skills learnt in mother tongue do not have to be re-taught when the child transfers to a second language</li>
  <li>Children learning in mother tongue enjoy school more and learn faster due to feeling comfortable in their environment</li>
  <li>Self-esteem is higher for children learning in mother tongue</li>
  <li>Parent-child interaction increases as the parent can assist with homework</li>
  <li>Studies show that children that capitalise on learning through multilingualism enjoy a higher socio-economic status and earn higher earnings</li>
  <li>The level of development of children’s mother tongue is a strong predictor of their second language development.</li>
  <li>Mother tongue promotion in the school helps develop not only the mother tongue but also children’s abilities in the majority of  school language.</li>
  <li>Children’s mother tongues are fragile and easily lost in the early years of school.</li>
  <li><strong>To reject a child’s language in the school is to reject the child</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>In a situation where the usage of mother tongue is limited to inter-personal communication within the family circle, students are obliged to renounce allegiance to their mother tongue to be accepted in the dictated discourse and society. And, the distressing scenario is that the assimilation policy may ultimately make the future generations have the conviction that <em>“my mother tongue is not good enough and just let it go”</em>, and that’s probably the end of a language…</p>

<h2 id="a-linguistic-crisis">A linguistic crisis</h2>

<p>There has been so much effort in protecting endangered languages and even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_revitalization" target="_blank">revitalize a language</a>. The whole point of <em>language</em> is to communicate. But what if a language is gradually being used less and less? How a language can remain productive with respect to the new concepts for which a word is needed?</p>

<p>With respect to the Kurdish language, there is a crisis not only for the speakers, but also for the language itself. I can mention two consequences as follows:</p>

<h4 id="lack-of-terminology">Lack of terminology</h4>

<p>Coining words and neologisms requires a thorough knowledge about a language, but making those words live and used requires social and political support. This is simply not possible for Kurdish. Therefore, scholars struggle to speak in a “clean” Kurdish, a Kurdish without much foreign terms. Having said that, the vocabulary of the mother tongue when is not taught, undergoes unpleasant changes, particularly through word borrowing and phonology.</p>

<h4 id="the-state-of-being-less-resourced">The state of being less-resourced</h4>

<p>I strongly believe that one of the main reasons that Kurdish is still less-resourced, <a href="https://sinaahmadi.github.io/posts/is-kurdish-a-less-resourced-language.html" target="_blank">as I have already discussed</a>, is due to lack of contribution of the speakers to create new resources and tools for the language. This is due to the usage of second languages for formal communications.</p>

<h2 id="multilingualism-is-an-opportunity-not-a-threat">Multilingualism is an opportunity not a threat</h2>

<p>Unluckily, the benefits of mother tongue education and multilingualism is not evident to everyone. In a country with such ethnic diversities, like Iran and Turkey, multilingualism should not be considered as a threat but as an opportunity. Learning new languages is joyful, but it should not be forced. No language is better than the others and no language deserves to be disregarded. And this is not that clear for many yet!</p>
