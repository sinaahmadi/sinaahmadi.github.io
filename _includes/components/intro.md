I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Computational Linguistics](https://www.cl.uzh.ch/en.html) at the University of Zurich, where I work with Prof. Rico Sennrich's group on advancing natural language processing (NLP) for linguistically diverse communities. My research lies at the intersection of computational linguistics, machine learning, and language preservation, with a particular focus on developing scalable solutions for languages with limited digital resources. Prior to this position, I conducted research on the same theme at [Dr. Antonios Anastasopoulos's group](https://nlp.cs.gmu.edu/) within the Department of Computer Science at George Mason University.
