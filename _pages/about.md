I hold an M.Sc. in Machine Learning from [Paris Descartes University](https://www.mi.parisdescartes.fr/){:target="_blank"} (2016-17) and an M.Sc. in Natural Language Processing from [Sorbonne Nouvelle University](http://www.univ-paris3.fr/){:target="_blank"} (2014-16). During my masters, I worked in different research groups, namely at [LIP6](https://www.lip6.fr/?LANG=en){:target="_blank"}, [LIMSI](https://www.limsi.fr/en/){:target="_blank"}, and [LIPN](http://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/){:target="_blank"}, on quite various fields of co-reference resolution, language generation and neural machine translation (here is one of [my master's theses](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00660){:target="_blank"}). Back in 2013, as a member of the Kurdish Language Processing Project ([KLPP](http://klpp.github.io/){:target="_blank"}) I developed some of the fundamental language processing tools for Kurdish. I obtained my B.Sc. in Software Engineering in 2014 at [University of Kurdistan](https://en.uok.ac.ir/EN){:target="_blank"}, Faculty of Engineering.

As a multidisciplinary explorer, my research experiences and academic background lie at the junction of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. I am also interested in less-resourced languages and particularly, Kurdish language processing. I still work on Kurdish-related NLP projects part-time. My first experiences in NLP date back to 2010, when I started my Bachelor's. Interested in linguistics, I was curious in creating language processing tools by extracting rules. In addition to the basic courses in programming and data strucuture, formal languages and theory of automata showed me the way towards NLP in a "formal" way. This is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4uV91s7W2o){:target="_blank"} of my spell-checker and translator (Kurdish &#8596; English/Persian/Arabic)) for Kurdish language, implemented based on the [Soundex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex){:target="_blank"} algorithm.

On my personal side, I have a voracious appetite for knowledge about languages. In 2011, I wrote a formalizion of the Sorani Kurdish grammar and published it in the form of an e-book (in Persian). The book got mostly positive feedbacks and, was and is still being downloaded. Currently, I spend part of my spare time on learning languages, Modern Greek and German. I am also interested in history and admire Hellenism, with all its glorious aspects. Although I like all types of art, my only artistic competence is in violin. I have had two public performances so far, [Vivaldi's Concerto in A minor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTPiZup0QmM){:target="_blank"} in my [home town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanandaj){:target="_blank"}, and [Telemann's concerto for 4 violins No. 2 in D major](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZIRE-9EL-E){:target="_blank"} in Hôpital de la Collégiale.
