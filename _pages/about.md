I received my Ph.D. from the [Insight Centre for Data Analytics](https://www.insight-centre.org/){:target="_blank"} at [University of Galway](https://www.universityofgalway.ie){:target="_blank"} in 2022, under the supervision of Dr. John McCrae. My doctoral research focused on lexicographic data linking and natural language processing, working closely with [ELEXIS](https://elex.is/){:target="_blank"} (European Lexicographic Infrastructure). Prior to this, I completed an MSc in Machine Learning from [Paris Descartes University](https://www.mi.parisdescartes.fr/){:target="_blank"} and an MA in Natural Language Processing from [Sorbonne Nouvelle University](http://www.univ-paris3.fr/){:target="_blank"}, conducting research at several laboratories in France, ([LIP6](https://www.lip6.fr/?LANG=en){:target="_blank"}, [LIMSI](https://www.limsi.fr/en/){:target="_blank"}, and [LIPN](http://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/){:target="_blank"}).

### Research Vision

My research is motivated by my deep belief that **every language community deserves access to modern language technology**. This drives my work in:

1. **Low-resourced NLP**: Developing innovative approaches to tackle fundamental challenges in low-resource scenarios, from script normalization to machine translation
2. **Language technology for everyone**: Creating practical, solution-oriented tools and resources that address real-world needs
3. **Community-centered and open-source development**: Working directly with language communities while ensuring all outcomes are openly available

Languages are not merely data points in my researchâ€”they represent living communities, cultural heritage, and human expression. I've had the privilege of working with over 40 languages across multiple language families. Do you need help developing language technology for your language? Let me know!

Beyond research, I'm passionate about languages and music. As an amateur violinist, I've performed [Vivaldi's Concerto in A minor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTPiZup0QmM){:target="_blank"} and [Telemann's concerto for 4 violins No. 2 in D major](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZIRE-9EL-E){:target="_blank"} in public concerts.
